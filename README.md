# pulser
Scalable pulsing images overlays for use in Yudu Publisher


# How to use

By changing the query string in Yudu Publiser you can customize the pulsing image, image size and the url link.

If no image is specified then the default image will be used.

There are 3 size settings 

- small
- medium (default)
- large

So for example to display a pulsing special offer image, which links to the Yudu website and is size small, you would write as follows:

```
?image=special.png&link=http://www.yudu.com&size=small
```
