# pulser
Scalable pulsing images overlays for use in Yudu Publisher


# How to use

By changing the query string in Yudu Publiser you can customize the pulsing image and the url link.

If no image is specified then the default image will be used.

So for example to display a pulsing special offer image which links to the Yudu website you would write as follows:

```
?image=special.png&link=http://www.yudu.com
```
